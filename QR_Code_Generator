This project is a Python-based QR Code Generator that allows users to quickly create customized QR codes for text, URLs, or any input data. 
It demonstrates practical knowledge of Python libraries, user input handling, and file generation.

The project highlights my ability to build small but functional automation tools using Python
— skills that are directly applicable to real-world software development and data-driven applications.
